# GraphQL for VS Code

This package provide some syntax highlighting and snippeds for the GraphQL language. Files ending with `.gql` or `.graphql` will be automatically handled.

This is an early stage package, it doesnâ€™t include the following desirable features:

* [ ] Symbols identification allowing refactoring tools to work corrently (eg. to rename a field)
* [ ] Better syntax highlighting that support variables, types, schemas, etc.
* [ ] Inline highlighting in JavaScript/Typescript code with the ES6 `graphql\`query { }\`` template string
* [ ] Client side autocompletion based on some server-side schema, similar to what Graph<em>i</em>ql is doing

And more :)
